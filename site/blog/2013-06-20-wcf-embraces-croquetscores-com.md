Tim Murphy, the owner and developer of croquetscores.com, and the World Croquet Federation 
have today reached a 12 month co-operative agreement regarding the website. The WCF will pay 
the annual hosting costs of croquetscores.com in return for Tim Murphy continuing to evolve the 
results website for the good of the game.

The croquetscores.com website allows tournament managers anywhere in the world to easily 
provide up to the minute results of events which they are managing. During the first year, it is 
planned to add a live commentary facility and possibly further features including lawn diagrams and 
live scores of games in progress.

The WCF world championships during this initial agreement period are:

1. WCF Association Croquet World Championship 2013
2. WCF Association Croquet World Team Championship 2014 Tier 1 (MacRobertson Shield)
3. WCF Womenâ€™s Golf Croquet World Championship 2014

croquetscores.com will provide an archive output of the scores shortly after each WCF Event, and 
also simplifies the input of accurate results into the World Ranking systems. 

During the agreement, the website will be available without charge to any croquet player, WCF 
Member association and the WCF. It is the intention of both parties to enter into a long term 
agreement at the end of this initial 12 month period.
