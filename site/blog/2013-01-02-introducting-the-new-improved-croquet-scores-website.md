[croquetscores.com](http://www.croquetscores.com) is now ready to be used by all tournament managers. [croquetscores.com](http://www.croquetscores.com) displays scores live to the internet as they are entered!

You can report the result of your entire tournament on the website – create all your blocks (be they knock-out, round robin or swiss); automatically create score grids; enter scores; edit players and games as they happen. Editing is now easy for tournament managers thanks to the new edit/delete option next to every entry.

[croquetscores.com](http://www.croquetscores.com) now has an offshoot – [trycroquetscores.apphb.com](http://trycroquetscores.apphb.com) – so you can learn the system and develop your confidence before you go live to the world.

[croquetscores.com](http://www.croquetscores.com) is a simple program to learn, but has multiple help pages to assist you through the process. 

This new version is focussed on improving the site for tournament managers. The next version will be focussed on improving the site for viewing results.

Results can be viewed in the order they are entered for the tournament or in the blocks in either grid, summary or order of play. Results are also tweeted at https://twitter.com/croquetscores.

The next major tournament to use [croquetscores.com](http://www.croquetscores.com) will be the New Zealand Open.

Why not use it for your next tournament?
