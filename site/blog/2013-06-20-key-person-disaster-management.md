The World Croquet Federation (WCF) has raised founded fears of croquetscores.com be lost to the croquet community should I (Tim Murphy) not be able to continue running the site. With that in mind I make the follow announcement.

In case of death or permanent incapacitation and I have a life-partner then that person has de-facto power of attorney of croquetscores.com. My current wife, Nicole Murphy, is aware of this announcement.

In case of death or permanent incapacitation and I do not have a life-partner then I wish the following to occur:

* All code for croquetscores.com become open source.
* Ownership of croquetscores.com domain name and current production site is transferred to the WCF.

The WCF and I will come to suitable arrangements to enact this announcement if required.

## Termination

Tim Murphy may cease this arrangement by giving 90 days notice on croquetscores.com.
