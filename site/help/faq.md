No. gateballscores.com runs in all modern browsers including mobile devices.

##### Q) Can our long running club tournament stay in "latest tournaments" list until the tournament's conclusion.

Sorry no. The latest tournaments list on the home page is designed for quick access to the 20 most recent active tournaments. 

Long running club tournaments are very welcome on gateballscores.com however if we allowed these tournaments to remain in the last tournaments list until they complete the latest tournaments list would lose its effectiveness.
